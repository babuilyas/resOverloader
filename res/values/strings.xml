    Welcome to resOverloader.\n
    resOverloader is fully working and helps android rooted users to use any foreign application in local language.\n
    The application works in Xposed framework. <a href='http://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/resoverloader-overload-applications-res-t2743634'>Learn more</a>\n\n  
    The GUI will allow users to select and translate any application to any locale/language on the fly in near future.
    \n
    If you like my idea and want to support further development, please donate a juice to my kids. Thank you.
